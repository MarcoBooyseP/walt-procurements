# Working With Agent Core

This project uses a project-local harness for context management and version control in AI-assisted development.

## First Action

The first action in every session is typically to get up to date with the project context:

```bash
python -B .agent_core/harness/main.py onboard
```

Be on the lookout for trigger phrases like "Let's get to work", "Let's go" or "Get onboarded". If you see one, run the onboard command to get started.

Use this local Python invocation for harness commands. Do not assume a global CLI is installed on `PATH`.

Onboard gives you everything you need: project info, coding guidelines, active specs, tasks, todos, memories, and recent work logs. The onboard output includes all available commands and project state.

**Note:** The onboard command (and indeed many of the harness commands) performs git/network operations such as fetch and rebase. It must be ran it in an elevated shell with outbound network access. Run all harness commands with such elevation.

## About Agent Core

Agent Core is a project-local CLI tool for managing project context in AI-assisted development. It uses a file-first, git-native architecture where all project state is stored as markdown files with YAML frontmatter in the `.agent_core/` directory.

### Project State

Project-owned state lives in `.agent_core/`:

- `.agent_core/config.toml`
- `.agent_core/user_mappings.toml`
- `.agent_core/specs/`
- `.agent_core/todos/`
- `.agent_core/memories/`
- `.agent_core/logs/`
- `.agent_core/docs/`

### Concepts and Commands

**Note**: For all of the agent core commands, the global python interpreter should ALWAYS be used.

**Specs (larger pieces of planned work):**
Specs are high-level feature or change specifications linked to GitHub issues. They are used when work needs planning, task breakdown, assignment, a worktree, and a PR lifecycle.

- `python -B .agent_core/harness/main.py spec new "title"` - Create a draft spec.
- `python -B .agent_core/harness/main.py spec sync <slug>` - Create or update the linked GitHub issue after the spec body and tasks are ready.
- `python -B .agent_core/harness/main.py spec assign <slug>` - Assign the spec and create its worktree. DO NOT ASSIGN SPECS WITHOUT EXPLICIT CONSENT.
- `python -B .agent_core/harness/main.py spec complete <slug> "detailed commit message"` - Create the PR and mark the spec merge-ready.

**Promotions (advancing protected branches):**
A promotion advances the shared linear history from `dev` to `test`, or from `test` to `main`. Treat requests such as "merge dev into test", "promote test to main", or equivalent language as promotion requests. Do not use raw `git merge`, direct pushes, or legacy merge commands for them.

The normal workflow is reviewed through a pull request:

- `python -B .agent_core/harness/main.py promotion create <test|main>` synchronizes and checks out the source branch (`dev` for a test promotion or `test` for a production promotion), then creates an ignored temporary Markdown draft for the promotion's pull request description. It does not push anything or create a branch or pull request. Remain on that source branch, treat the tracked code as read-only, inspect and test the complete promotion scope there, and fill in the ignored draft identified by the command.
- After the description is complete, run the execution command printed by the harness from the source branch. It validates the draft, creates a remote-only snapshot branch from the exact source checkout that was inspected, opens the promotion pull request with the completed description, removes the temporary draft, and returns to `dev`.

Do not interpret an ordinary request to merge or promote into a protected branch as permission to bypass review. If the user explicitly asks to skip the pull request or promote directly, run `python -B .agent_core/harness/main.py promotion create <test|main> --no-pr` without adding any other options, explain the warning printed by the harness, and stop for the required confirmation.

A full-deployment request is a separate path. Treat only explicit phrases such as "full deployment", "full deploy", or "deploy everything" as this path. Do not infer it from an ordinary promote, merge, or skip-the-PR request.

When that request is made, advance both hops without pull requests, in order: first `test`, then `main`. For each hop, run `python -B .agent_core/harness/main.py promotion create <test|main> --no-pr` and immediately continue with the confirmation command printed by the harness. Do not stop for a second confirmation. The full-deployment request itself is the confirmation.

If a hop reports that nothing is available to promote, continue with the remaining hop. Report what was advanced and what was already current.

Do not mention or invent extra flags. Use only the follow-up command the harness prints.

Promotion pull requests must be completed with the harness `pr merge` path (pure fast-forward). Do not use GitHub's Merge, Squash, or Rebase buttons on promotion PRs. If destination history has already diverged through merge-only commits, the promotion commands automatically reunify by merging the destination tip into the promotion source, then continue the fast-forward. Report reunify output to the user when it happens.

**Pull request reviews:**
When the user says "Let's review the PR", "Let's review the promotion", "There is an open PR", or similar, this workflow replaces normal onboarding. Run `python -B .agent_core/harness/main.py pr review` without a PR reference. It queries open pull requests and prints the authoritative discovery and selection instructions. Do not choose a pull request on the user's behalf.

After the user identifies the pull request, run the review command printed by the harness, read the generated context in full, and report findings before taking any PR action. The review command surfaces the available response and merge commands when they become relevant. Follow confirmation instructions exactly and never add options that the harness has not instructed you to use.

**Tasks (concrete work inside a spec):**
Tasks are actionable work items that belong to a spec. When run from a spec worktree, task commands infer the active spec. Use `--spec <slug>` only when managing a specific spec from outside its worktree (this will be the case most of the time, since planning and spec creation happens in non spec branches - where specs are not yet "active").

- `python -B .agent_core/harness/main.py task new "title" "detailed description with implementation notes if necessary" --spec <slug>` - Create a task in the active spec.
- `python -B .agent_core/harness/main.py task complete <task_slug> "detailed notes about what was done"` - Mark a task complete in the active spec (this command only really makes sense when within a spec branch/worktree).

**Todos (standalone matters that require attention):**
Todos are short notes on tasks that need to be completed or triaged. If the workload of a todo is large, create a spec for the implementation. Treat todos as a mechanism to draw attention to problems or changes, not full guidelines. As such, **when starting work on a todo, claim it immediately**.

- `python -B .agent_core/harness/main.py todo new "title" "description"` - Create a todo and linked GitHub issue.
- `python -B .agent_core/harness/main.py todo list` - List all open todos.
- `python -B .agent_core/harness/main.py todo claim <slug> <user>` - Claim a todo and close the linked GitHub issue.

**Work Logs (session records):**
Work logs capture what happened in a session, what changed, blockers, and next steps. They are end-of-session artifacts that help the next agent continue with accurate context.

- `python -B .agent_core/harness/main.py log new` - Create a work log for the session. This is an extremely important command that should be run towards the end of every session. DO NOT create work logs without user permission. If you find you are at a logical point where a work log could/should be created, YOU MUST first inform your intent to the user and ask permission.

**Memories (atomic notes on patterns and conventions)**
Memories are short, atomic notes about patterns, conventions, or preferences in the codebase. They are shown during onboard so every session has access to accumulated project knowledge.

- **When the user asks you to remember something** - create a memory with `python -B .agent_core/harness/main.py memory new "title" "content"`.
- **When you notice a useful pattern** - suggest creating a memory, but only create it if the user agrees.
- Do not use external memory tools. Use the project-local harness memory command instead.
- `python -B .agent_core/harness/main.py memory list` - List all memories.
- `python -B .agent_core/harness/main.py memory show <slug>` - Show memory details.
- `python -B .agent_core/harness/main.py memory update <slug> "new content"` - Update a memory.
- `python -B .agent_core/harness/main.py memory delete <slug>` - Delete a memory.

**Documents (durable project context):**
Documents are durable project context files that appear during onboard. They belong in `.agent_core/docs/`. Their creation and management is done manually by the user. DO NOT create or update files in `.agent_core/docs` without explicit consent.

Harness-provided optional docs can be managed after the user gives explicit consent:

- `python -B .agent_core/harness/main.py docs list` - List available docs and their installation state.
- `python -B .agent_core/harness/main.py docs add <slug> [slug ...]` - Install optional docs.
- `python -B .agent_core/harness/main.py docs update [slug ...]` - Update installed optional docs.
- `python -B .agent_core/harness/main.py docs remove <slug> [slug ...]` - Remove installed optional docs.

Update and removal refuse to overwrite or delete locally modified managed docs. Follow the command's recovery instructions and never authorize an override without explicit user consent.

**Repair Commands (manual reconciliation):**
Repair commands are for explicit recovery or reconciliation. Do not run them as part of normal onboarding; `onboard` already syncs version control and issue state before building context. Any repair command should be a last resort.

- `python -B .agent_core/harness/main.py sync issues` - Reconcile local specs and todos with linked GitHub issues when issue metadata has drifted or a previous sync failed.

## Notes

- Do not `cd` into the project directory unless necessary; your shell is typically already at the project root.
- Do not enter plan mode - the harness handles planning through specs and tasks.
- Do not use external task management tools - use harness tasks and todos instead.
- Do not create specs unless prompted - often times work happens out of spec.
- When running any harness command that talks to GitHub, **ALWAYS** allow for at least 60 seconds of execution time because the GitHub API can hang.
- `python -B .agent_core/harness/main.py log new` is not an interactive command. When prompted to "Create a log" or "Let's log", run the log command and follow the instructions.
- Do not create logs arbitrarily, logs are meant to be end of session artifacts that inform the next session. If it is your estimation that a session is becoming long or if your interaction with the user would indicate that some form of context corruption has occurred (constant pushback, frustration etc.), you may suggest creating a log and changing over to a fresh session.
- When working in the context of a spec inside a worktree directory, you are ABSOLUTELY NEVER allowed to perform mutating action on the main repo directory in any way shape or form. If any merge or rebase fails inside a spec, you must resolve the issues inside that spec.
- Do not add your name or the fact that you co-authored something to any commit messages. Commit messages should be clean and descriptive, with no extra information.
- Do not run the onboard command arbitrarily - its output can be very large and typically within the scope of a session it will not provide additional information. The purpose of the onboard command is to sync version control and build initial context. No other time is it necessary unless the user asks.
- The outputs produced by harness commands are to be strictly adhered to. Especially in cases where the harness instructs you to stop and give feedback. This is important to keep a human in the loop.
- When working within a spec, DO NOT CREATE TASKS unless explicitly prompted to do so.
- Run commands from the project root unless a command explicitly says otherwise.
- When you encounter a file or changes that you did not make, you must assume the user made those changes *and* that their preference is reflected by those changes. You are free to ask about them if you notice something strange or incorrect, but as a rule you should not modify or undo such changes, rather you should incorporate them as updated context into your own working session. 
- When you are interrupted by the user with "Stop" or "No" or similar, you must **IMMEDIATELY** stop what you are doing, give a brief explanation of what you were busy with, and wait for further instructions. DO NOT continue working.
- Refrain from performing actions without user consent unless the action is trivial or has very low risk. Always explain choices and invite user feedback.
- Strive for a workflow loop where:
    > - The *user* gives an instruction.
    > (loop)
    >   - *You* do research, establish and understand the problem.
    >   - *You* provide context and diagnostics to the user and clarify material ambiguity using the Think Before Coding guidelines below.
    >   - The *user* gives feedback.
    > (end loop if feedback intends for implementation to proceed)
    > - *You* implement the changes/updates as discussed with the *user*.
    > - *You* provide a clear and informative summary of what you did and what changed. 
  This kind of workflow is not always possible nor practical, but especially when larger changes need to happen, this should be adhered to. "Quick and dirty" changes prompted via direct instruction can be implemented at your discretion.

# General Principles

## Key Principle

Remember: "Whenever I'm about to do something, I think, 'Would an idiot do that?' And if they would, I do not do that thing." - Dwight Schrute

## Communication Style
- Be conversational but professional
- Think through considerations and requirements before writing code
- Planning first, then execution - we discuss the problem before implementing
- Surface uncertainty and tradeoffs clearly, following the Think Before Coding guidelines below.

## Code Quality Standards
- Prefer self-explanatory code. Use comments to explain non-obvious reasoning, constraints, or tradeoffs; avoid comments that merely narrate what the code does.
- Avoid print statements apart from ad-hoc testing, when necessary defer to formal logging
- Follow established patterns and conventions in the codebase
- Prioritize clarity and maintainability over cleverness

## Performance Considerations
- Chunked processing for batch operations when applicable
- Database query optimization with proper indexing
- Memory management for large batch processing

## File and Folder Structure

- Follow the project's established layout and framework conventions. For new areas, organize files and folders around cohesive domains or features.
- Give each source file a focused responsibility. Keep related code together and separate concerns that change for different reasons.
- Start with a shallow structure. Introduce subfolders when they clarify meaningful boundaries, not merely to categorize a few files.
- Keep helpers and types close to the domain that owns them. Move code into shared modules only when it serves multiple areas; avoid catch-all `utils`, `helpers`, or `common` files.
- Prefer descriptive names that make a file's purpose clear without opening it.
- Keep dependencies between modules explicit. Avoid circular imports and splits that require unrelated modules to coordinate through shared mutable state.
- Use robust error handling wherever applicable.

### File Size and Refactoring

If a source file grows past 500 lines, treat that as a strong signal to split or refactor. Large files often accumulate mixed concerns, duplicated helpers, and hard-to-reason-about state. When your changes push a file past this threshold, or substantially extend an already oversized file, identify a cohesive part to extract before adding more.

Prefer extracting by domain or responsibility: domain-specific types, cohesive helpers, or a focused submodule. Do not split files mechanically to meet the line count, compress code to hide its size, or introduce unnecessary indirection. A useful split should make each module easier to understand and change independently.

Exceptions should be exceedingly rare, such as generated code or externally maintained vendored components. Explain why an exception is justified; compilation and passing tests alone do not justify keeping a file whole.

Keep refactoring within the requested scope. If an existing oversized file needs a broader restructuring than the task warrants, flag it and propose a follow-up rather than silently expanding the task.

## Functional Approach
- Prefer functional and procedural programming patterns over heavy OOP
- OOP is only used when it provides clear benefits
- Minimal abstractions - prefer explicit over implicit, declarative over imperative

### Source Formatting

- Do not hard-wrap lines just to satisfy an arbitrary line length. This project assumes modern editors with line wrapping.
- Keep user-facing strings, command strings, markdown output fragments, and simple expressions on one line when that is clearer.
- Only split a line when it improves structure or readability, such as a genuinely complex expression, a long data literal, or nested call arguments. When applicable use multiline strings for this.
- Do not reflow existing prose or strings unless the requested change requires it.

# Behavioral Guidelines

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

### 1. Think Before Coding

**Make assumptions explicit. Surface material uncertainty and tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- Check the available project context before asking for clarification.
- Ask when ambiguity would materially affect scope, behavior, architecture, or the consequences of an action. Explain the uncertainty and pause the affected work until it is resolved; continue independent work where useful.
- For routine, low-risk implementation choices within the authorized scope, follow established conventions and use judgment. State assumptions that affect the result without requiring confirmation for every minor decision.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.

### 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- Introduce abstractions only when they clarify responsibilities or remove meaningful duplication. A focused function or module can be worthwhile with one caller; do not add layers solely for hypothetical reuse.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" -> "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" -> "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" -> "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```text
1. [Step] -> verify: [check]
2. [Step] -> verify: [check]
3. [Step] -> verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria like "make it work" require constant clarification.

---------------------------------------------------------------

# Testing Philosophy

Testing is critical to maintaining software quality, but not all tests are created equal. Focus on testing meaningful functionality that could actually break and impact the application.

### Test Structure
- Follow the project's established test layout and framework conventions. When establishing a new layout, default to a `tests/` directory that mirrors the source structure.
- Focus on meaningful functionality that could realistically break
- Avoid "idiot tests" that test framework behavior or trivial logic

### What to Test
- **Business logic**: Complex algorithms, validation rules, data transformations
- **API endpoints**: Request/response handling, authentication, error cases
- **Database operations**: Query correctness, constraint validation, data integrity
- **Integration points**: External API calls, file processing, inter-service communication

### What NOT to Test
- Framework internals 
- Third-party library behavior 
- Trivial getters/setters or simple data transformations
- Implementation details that don't affect public behavior

**Test Quality Principles:**
1. **Clarity Over Quantity** - Fewer, well-focused tests are better than many redundant ones
2. **Test Behavior, Not Implementation** - Focus on what the code does, not how it does it
3. **Meaningful Assertions** - Each test should verify something that could realistically fail
4. **Isolated Tests** - Tests should not depend on each other or external state
5. **Descriptive Names** - Test names should clearly describe what they're validating

**When in Doubt, Ask:**
- "Does this test validate critical business logic or user-facing behavior?"
- "Could this functionality realistically break in the way it is being tested?"

Apply this review to tests introduced or changed in the current task. Revise or remove those tests when they do not verify meaningful behavior, while preserving coverage required by the task. If an unrelated existing test appears unhelpful, flag it rather than deleting it without an explicit request.

NEVER run a full test suite unless specifically asked to. focus on specific tests related to the feature/functionality you are working on.
